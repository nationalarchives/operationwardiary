        <h1>A few words about plankton</h1>
        <p><img src="./images/copepod.jpg" class="framed left" /></p>
        <p>Plankton comes from the Greek word planktos meaning “wanderer” or “drifter”. As a group, plankton are an eclectic collection of organisms adrift in the oceanic waters. The classification of an organism as ‘plankton’ has nothing to do with its biological grouping, but rather with its inability to swim actively against oceanic currents.</p>
        <p><img src="./images/DSCN7015.jpg" class="framed right" /></p>
        <p>Plankton vary widely in size from thousandths of an inch (0.05 mm) or less to several feet in length (> 1m) or more. Most are less than an inch (~ 2.5 cm). Some organisms spend all their life as plankton and drift along with the ocean currents, while others are only temporary passive passengers until they reach a certain size and age, allowing for movement in the open ocean or settlement into a coastal habitat.</p>
        <p>There are two main types of plankton: phytoplankton (plants) and zooplankton (animals). We are most interested in the zooplankton because our underwater camera system is optimized to capture the image of larger planktonic organisms, ranging from a few mm to a few centimeters which includes a wide variety of different organisms.</p>

        <h1>Why study plankton?</h1>
        <p>Planktonic organisms are critically important food source to the all ocean.  Small phytoplankton form the beginning of the food supply which are consumed by larger plankton, then those plankton by larger organisms all the way up to fish and the largest species of whales found in the sea. No plankton: no life in the ocean.</p>
        <p>Plankton also play an important role in the global carbon cycle capturing the sun’s energy and the atmosphere’s CO2 at the surface of the ocean and releasing it, via the above food chain, to other organisms and other areas of the ocean from shallow coastal areas to the deep ocean basins.</p>
        <p>Understanding where and when plankton occur at different depths in the ocean allows scientists to get a global understanding of the function and health of the ocean from small to global scales.</p>
        <p>Plankton are also fascinating in their diversity of intricate and beautiful shapes. The weightlessness of life in the ocean environment allows for very delicate and complex body designs, which are almost impossible to keep intact with normal means of collection. Imaging systems provide a first glimpse of these amazing animals in their natural environment, and may even lead to discovery of new species.</p>

        <h1>How do we get the images?</h1>
        <p><img src="./images/isiis.jpg" class="framed left" /></p>
        <p>The In Situ Ichthyoplankton Imaging System (ISIIS) is one of a few systems in the world capable of improving the way we study plankton to better understand their life and function in the marine environment. ISIIS is, in some ways, a “virtual net” which captures the images of the organisms and information about their immediate surroundings. By sampling continuously, the result is a collection of digital images that record the exact location of the various plankton organisms in relation to each other and the environment in which they live. Further, the images are recorded onto a simple hard drive instead of slurry of plankton all mixed together in a sample jar with formaldehyde (yech!).</p
        <p>ISIIS is composed of a macro-camera system with its own illumination and is integrated into an underwater vehicle with a variety of additional sensors to measure the depth, salinity and temperature of the water, as well as such properties as dissolved oxygen, light level, and even how much chlorophyll a (measure of primary production) is present. Together, the camera and sensors provide detailed profiles and tracks of what plankton are where and what the ocean environment around them is like.

      content: '''
        <h1>Some notable members of the plankton community</h1>
        <p>Plankton are drifters – plants and animals that live in the ocean possessing limited abilities to swimming against a current. ‘Plankton’ typically comprise the bottom of the food chain and serve as food for many larger animals, from fish to marine mammals and birds. There are many different plant and animal groups that make up the plankton community, and as a whole are probably as diverse as any other habitat in the world, even including tropical rain forests and coral reefs. Below are a few of the more common planktonic organisms in the size classes easily observed by ISIIS.</p>

      jellies:
        title: 'Jellyfish and relatives'
        content: 'Despite their name, jellyfish aren’t actually fish, they’re planktonic invertebrates related to corals and anemones. Jellyfish are a diverse groups of animals unlike any other that you’ve ever seen: comprised mostly of water (over 95%) in a gelatinous body construct, they can vary from microscopic sizes (a few millimeters) to some that are over 40 meters (130 feet) in length. When you think of jellyfish, you are probably thinking about “true jellyfish,” which are the scyphomedusae, a group that includes the iconic Pacific Sea Nettle, but ‘jellyfish’ as a broad category also include a host of other relatives that include the little known, typically very small hydromedusae, which, nonetheless, are probably the most common jellyfish that you will see in these images. From there, the other members of the jellyfish category become more astonishing and bizarre: the siphonophores, which are colonial hydrozoans, often can form long, delicate chains; and the ctenophores, or comb jellies, which are the most ancient of all the jellies. All of the above have tentacles of varying length, number and orientation – leading to sometimes very unusual and distinct appearances.  Here we highlight a few different kinds, as well as some of their more common relatives.'

        scyphozoa:
          title: 'Scyphozoa'
          content: 'Scyphozoa, or scyphomedusa, are the “true jellyfish” and typically very large compared to the other organisms that we will see in our ISIIS images. This group includes some of the most spectacularly beautiful jellyfish and are often seen while snorkeling or scuba diving (e.g., moon jellies, sea nettles, etc). They are typically more pigmented and opaque than the other hydromedusae and siphonophores, and if seen, can cover an entire ISIIS image. They can be locally abundant when present in large blooms. However, since our system is optimized for smaller organisms, scyphozoans are rare in ISIIS images.'

        hydromedusae:
          title: 'Hydromedusae'
          content: [
            'This group of jellyfish is composed of over 800 species around the world, with diverse appearances and life history strategies. Many hydromedusae tend to have a two-part adult life cycle where they spend part of their life as a benthic polyp (attached to the sea-floor or on some kind of substrate) and the other part of their life as a pelagic medusa (swimming in the water column). However, most of our samples are sufficiently far from the coastal zones, so most of the hydromedusae that we see live their lives entirely in the pelagic zone (we call these “holoplanktonic.”) They also have diverse reproductive strategies and overall, are very fascinating creatures.'
            'In general, hydromedusae tend to be smaller and more diminutive than their scyphozoan cousins, but still have the classic “jellyfish” look: a circular body (bell) with a central mouth and gonads (reproductive organs), and anywhere from a few to many tentacles, which they use to capture prey. Like other jellyfish, hydromedusa tentacles contain stinging cells for immobilizing prey, but all the species in the west coast of the USA cannot seriously harm people. In our images, the hydromedusae will have bells ranging from a few millimeters to nearly two centimeters in diameter. Hydromedusae tend to be transparent or translucent, though some have various degrees of pigmentation as well.  They can be found alone (solitary) or in large swarms in the ocean.'
          ]

        solmaris:
          title: 'Solmaris sp.'
          content: 'This small, flat looking, transparent jellyfish is quite hard to detect with the naked eye, but are beautifully imaged by ISIIS. Solmaris is a type of hydromedusa called a narcomedusa, which lives its entire life in the pelagic zone and consumes only other gelatinous plankton. Narcomedusae are curious because they swim in short bursts with their tentacles pointed forward, in front of their body. Solmaris has one to three dozen somewhat rigid tentacles and a flat, lens shaped bell, but other narcomedusae can look quite different. Off the coast of California, Solmaris range in size from a few millimeters to a little over 1 centimeter in bell diameter. They are sometimes found in large blooms off of central and southern California.'

        siphonophores:
          title: 'Siphonophores'
          content: 'Elongated, usually transparent, jellyfish-like animals, siphonophores are unique within the Cnidarians as they are actually composed of a colony of many small individuals (called zooids), each serving different functions. Though there are other colonial Cnidarians (corals are a well known example), none of the others have developed the kind of specialization that siphonophores have. Though the most well-known siphonophore is the Portuguese Man o’ War, this organism is actually fairly different from most siphonophores found in the ocean. Most siphonophores do not reside solely at the surface, but are found at all depths (and some can perform lengthy daily migrations from depth to the surface and back). Pelagic siphonophores are divided into two groups: the larger, Physonect siphonophores (see image above) have a gas float at the top of their body, followed by many swimming bells and a trailing tentacle-structure. This structure contains the zooids specialized for reproduction and feeding, which include a deadly network of retractable stinging tentacles; and the Calycophoran siphonophores which are smaller, lack the gas float, and typically contain just one or two swimming bells. Siphonophores are predators feeding on a large selection of zooplankton ranging from copepods to fish larvae. They can reproduce asexually by budding and produce hundreds of offspring. Some siphonophores, such as the Portuguese Man o‘ War, are known to cause extremely painful stings to humans.'

        ctenophores:
          title: 'Ctenophores'
          content: 'Ctenophores, also known as “comb jellies,” are beautiful ocean drifters moving slowly with the help of very small cilia rows arranged around their round or oblong bodies. Unlike the true jellies (Cnidarians), ctenophores lack stinging nematocysts and have developed other strategies for capturing prey. Some use oral lobes to actively gulp their prey (including other species of ctenophores), whereas most have a pair of very long, sticky tentacles (up to 10 to 20 times their body size), which they use to collect smaller plankton (mostly copepods).  When prey are ensnared by their tentacles, they then initiate a flamenco-like dance to bring their tentacles to their mouths and ‘lick’ their tentacles clean of this nutrient rich food. Most ctenophores are capable of bioluminescence (or biological light), which is quite faint and only visible in darkened conditions. Their bioluminescent organs are typically confined to the digestive canals that underlie each of the comb rows. Like the medusae, ctenophores are also capable of forming large blooms in the surface waters of many coastal areas.'

      pelagicTunicates:
        title: 'Pelagic Tunicates'
        content: 'Another largely gelatinous group of plankton, pelagic tunicates can be solitary or form large colonies (sometime hundreds of individuals and extending up to a few tens of meters in length). As a group, the pelagic tunicates are filter feeders meaning they filter the seawater through a pumping mechanism to capture and then extract their food. There are two main classes of tunicates: thaliaceans and appendicularians. Both are members of the phylum Chordata because of the presence of a larval notochord, which includes all animals with backbones (including humans). Among all of the plankton (except fishes), these animals are actually your closest relatives!'

        salpsAndDoliolids:
            title: 'Salps and doliolids'
            content: 'These belong to the class of organisms called Thaliaceans, which are planktonic tunicates with a barrel-looking body. Most salps are colonial; sometimes in long repeating chains. Others can be solitary and look like small barrels. Doliolids resemble salps, but typically have a tail of much smaller budding organisms, while colonial salps will usually be all the same size. Both salps and doliolids move in the water column by pumping water in and out of their gelatinous body to filter out their phytoplankton prey. They can reproduce asexually through budding (also shown).'

        larvaceans:
            title: 'Larvaceans (also called ‘Appendicularians’)'
            content: 'This tadpole-looking animal is a filter feeder. It secretes a mucous house around itself and creates a current, bringing small food particles into its mucous mesh, by gently beating its tail. If disturbed it can jump out of its house and escape predators. Larvaceans are an important source of food for some fish larvae (members of the tuna family in particular). A rather small organism (typically less than 5 mm), their mucous houses can be extensive (as shown), but without the house, they appear as small, s-shaped ‘tadpoles’.'

        copepods:
          title: 'Copepods'
          content: 'Copepods are tiny aquatic crustaceans, a group that also includes familiar animals such as crabs, lobsters and crayfish. Copepods are arguably the most important group of organisms in the world’s oceans, due to their abundance and ubiquity, from the polar regions to the tropics. They are highly speciose (over 21,000 species world wide) and are the largest source of protein and the largest biomass in the oceans. Most economically important fishes depend upon them as their major food source. Despite their importance, copepods are easily overlooked in favor of the larger, flashier marine animals. Although there is some variety in their shape and size, most have small (0.5-2 mm) opaque bodies with a pair of long sensory antennas. They have a hard exterior skeleton (exoskeleton) just like insects and crabs. Despite their small size, many are known to migrate daily to deeper waters to avoid predation and come up towards the surface at night to feed on phytoplankton.'

        shrimp:
          title: 'Shrimp (and relatives)'
          content: [
            'Shrimp and their relatives (including krill) also are crustaceans. In many marine ecosystems, shrimp and their relatives are very important in the food chain. In the California current ecosystem, they make up the base of a very productive marine ecosystem that supports lots of coastal fish, sharks, seals and whales. For example, blue whales, the largest animal in the world, feeds almost exclusively on krill.'
            'Shrimp are broadly divided into 3 groups: mysids, krill, and decapods. Though functionally distinct, for our purposes here, we will group these three types of animals into a “shrimp-like” category. Though it is difficult to tell these three groups apart in many instances, some differences do occur. Mysids are typically very skinny, whereas krill and decapod shrimp are bulkier and have longer back legs than mysids.'
          ]

        chaetognaths:
          title: 'Chaetognaths'
          content: 'Also known as arrow worms, chaetognaths are well known active predators on other zooplankton. They seize their prey using grasping spines located on either side of their head. They can ingest prey almost as big as themselves.  Their body is elongated like an arrow and transparent like glass. In the wild, we often find them oriented vertically in the water column: this is their hunting posture. Superficially, they can resemble larval fish.'

        pteropods:
          title: 'Pteropods'
          content: 'The name pteropod literally means “winged foot,” which is appropriate because these marine snails use two wing-like extensions of their foot to “fly” through the water, hence their other common name, “sea butterflies.” They usually have an opaque shell that has a triangular shape similar to a gnome’s hat, with the semi-translucent “winged feet” located at the base of the triangle. There are also some species that do not have shells but still have wing-like body parts. Also at the base of the food chain, pteropods are common food for krill, fish (such as the North Pacific juvenile salmon) and baleen whales. However, scientists are now worried about the effects of ocean acidification, which can dissolve the shells of these marine snails and consequently, impact the whole food chain that depends on these organisms.'

        polychaetes:
          title: 'Polychaetes'
          content: 'These planktonic worms are covered in legs. Moving their bodies in a snake-like motion, their legs serve as tiny paddles that push them through the water. Most grow to larger sizes and settle on the bottom in the sand or rocks, but a few species spend their entire lives as plankton.'

        radiolarian:
          title: 'Radiolarian (solitary and colonies)'
          content: 'Radiolarians are single-celled organisms (protozoa) that are often solitary (up to a few mm in diameter), but some also form relatively large colonies (up to a few cm in size). These colonies are composed of a large group radiolarians held together by a gelatinous structure, often resembling the shape of a long sock. These organisms, like most jelly-like organisms, are very hard to study with traditional methods because they are fragile and get destroyed by plankton nets.'

        This short tutorial will show you how to use the tools to mark and identify plankton.
        Before you start, it's a good idea to check out the "science" page to learn about the different species we're classifying.
        Your classifications will be combined with the classifications of other volunteers, so do your best, but don't worry if some seem hard.

      header: 'What we\'re marking'
      details: '''
        Let's start with the large tentacled creature to the right.
        To mark a creature, you need to draw lines across its major and minor axes.
        We're mainly interested in the size and direction of the plankton.
      '''

    majorAxis:
      header: 'Major axis'
      details: '''
        Always mark the length of the plankton first, from the "front" toward the "bottom".
        This will tell us how long the creature is and what direction it's moving.
        Remember to check the science page if you're not sure how to mark something.
        Do not include any tentacles!
      '''
      instruction: 'Drag vertically from the top of the bell across to where the tentacles start.'

    minorAxis:
      header: 'Minor axis'
      details: '''
        Now we'll mark the width of the creature.
      '''
      instruction: 'Drag from left to right across the bell.'

    chooseCategory:
      header: 'Narrow down possible species'
      details: '''
        A row of category icons has appeared. Choose the one that looks closest to the creature you see.
      '''
      instruction: 'Click the icon that best matches the creature.'

    chooseSpecies:
      header: 'Choose the species'
      details: '''
        From the new row of species icons, again click the closest match.
      '''
      instruction: 'Click the icon that best matches the creature.'

    badCoordinates:
      header: 'Close, but no cigar'
      details: '''
        It looks like the axes are a bit off.
        We've drawn some guides to help you out.
      '''
      instruction: 'Drag the handles at the end of each line until they match the guides.'

    wrongSpecies:
      header: 'A case of mistaken identity'
      details: '''
        This creature is actually a $species.
      '''
      instruction: 'Click the icon to re-open the menu, then choose the $species under the $category category.'

    markTheOtherOne:
      header: 'Mark the next creature'
      details: '''
        Try marking the creature in the top-right of the image on your own.
        It's tiny, but try your best to be accurate.
        You can always adjust the lines you've drawn by dragging the end points.
        Remember: Drag out the major axis (length), then the minor axis (width), then choose the species.
